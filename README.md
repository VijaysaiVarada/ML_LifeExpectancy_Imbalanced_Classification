# ML_LifeExpectancy_Imbalanced_Classification
Trained the below models to classify the countires whose life expectancy is below 50 years 
the best model is chosen based on the mean cv score and scoring metric used is F1 scoring

Classification Task:

1.	Basic Algorithms 
    1.	Naive Algorithm

    1.	Accuracy: Predict the majority class (class 0).
    2.	G-Mean: Predict a uniformly random class.
    3.	F-Measure: Predict the minority class (class 1).
    4.	ROC AUC: Predict a stratified random class.
    5.	PR ROC: Predict a stratified random class.
    6.	Brier Score: Predict majority class prior.
